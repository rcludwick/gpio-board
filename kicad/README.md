### The gpio board

The gpio board was created using KiCad 5.  (And should be renamed to something else)

### OSH Park

To make a board, use OSH Park.  Upload the `tristate.kicad_pcb` file.

### Parts

The connector is a .1" 2x5 connector.  

While the schematic notes 200 ohm resistors, these should be paired to the LED that you're using.

These are 1206 surface mounts, and can be bought from Digikey, Mouser, Aliexpress, Banggood.
